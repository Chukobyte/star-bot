# Star Bot

A repo that will star all repositories of a user who has starred this one.  [Star Bot](https://github.com/star-repo-bot) checks every 30 minutes and will process starring repos accordingly.  Any new repos that a user create after starring this repo will also be starred.  A user can opt out of having their repos starred by just unstarring the star bot and all the repos the user has will be unstarred.

Another thing that star bot does is stars 3 random repos once a day.
