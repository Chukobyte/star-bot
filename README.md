# Star Bot

A repo that will star all repositories of a user who has starred this one.  [Star Bot](https://github.com/star-repo-bot) checks every 30 minutes and will process starring repos accordingly.  Any new repos that a user create after starring this repo will also be starred.

Another thing that star bot does is star 3 random repos once a day.
